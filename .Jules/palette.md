## 2026-02-13 - Retrofitting Navigation Headers
**Learning:** When injecting navigation components into existing HTML files, CSS conflicts (like absolute positioning on buttons) must be explicitly overridden (e.g., `position: static`) rather than just appending new styles, as the old styles might still apply.
**Action:** When migrating UI components, check for and neutralize conflicting legacy CSS properties in the migration script.

## 2026-02-13 - [Adding Copy Button to Code Blocks]
**Learning:** When injecting JavaScript into Python f-string templates, remember to escape curly braces (`{` -> `{{`, `}` -> `}}`) to avoid syntax errors and runtime crashes. This is especially tricky when mixing CSS and JS in the same f-string block.
**Action:** Always verify f-string template injections with a unit test that parses the output or checks for successful execution.

## 2026-02-13 - Focus Visibility with Static Colors
**Learning:** When implementing global accessibility features like `*:focus-visible` in systems that use both CSS variables and hardcoded fallback colors (e.g. within generated templates), explicitly defining the `.dark` variant for static focus outlines ensures consistent contrast across theme switches.
**Action:** Always mirror focus styles explicitly in the `.dark` class scope when working outside environments with dynamically evaluated CSS variables.

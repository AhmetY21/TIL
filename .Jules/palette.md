## 2026-02-13 - Retrofitting Navigation Headers
**Learning:** When injecting navigation components into existing HTML files, CSS conflicts (like absolute positioning on buttons) must be explicitly overridden (e.g., `position: static`) rather than just appending new styles, as the old styles might still apply.
**Action:** When migrating UI components, check for and neutralize conflicting legacy CSS properties in the migration script.

## 2026-02-13 - [Adding Copy Button to Code Blocks]
**Learning:** When injecting JavaScript into Python f-string templates, remember to escape curly braces (`{` -> `{{`, `}` -> `}}`) to avoid syntax errors and runtime crashes. This is especially tricky when mixing CSS and JS in the same f-string block.
**Action:** Always verify f-string template injections with a unit test that parses the output or checks for successful execution.

## 2026-02-13 - [Focus Visible Outlines]
**Learning:** When using Playwright to verify focus-visible states visually, simulate keyboard navigation via `page.keyboard.press('Tab')` rather than simple clicks, as clicks will often not trigger the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class.
**Action:** Remember to use the Tab key and add a short `wait_for_timeout` before screenshots when verifying focus styles.

    <h2>Topic: The History of NLP: From Rules to Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>1- Provide formal definition, what is it and how can we use it?</strong></p>
<p>The history of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be broadly categorized into two major paradigms: Rule-based NLP and Statistical NLP. Understanding this historical transition is crucial for appreciating modern NLP techniques and their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule-based NLP (pre-1990s):</strong> This approach relied on explicit linguistic rules, often crafted by human experts, to process and understand language. These rules covered morphology, syntax, and semantics. A system would be built upon a large set of if-then rules to parse sentences, translate languages, or extract information. The emphasis was on <em>knowledge engineering</em>. It aimed to manually encode linguistic knowledge into computational systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Statistical NLP (post-1990s):</strong> With the advent of powerful computers and large datasets, statistical methods began to dominate. This approach uses probabilistic models learned from data to analyze and process language. Techniques like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Naive Bayes classifiers, and Maximum Entropy models became prevalent. It focused on <em>data-driven learning</em> where statistical patterns in data are used to infer linguistic structure and meaning. Statistical NLP replaced the dependence on human crafted rules by automatic learning of patterns and relationships from large quantities of text data (corpora). Later on, Machine learning techniques (Neural Networks, Deep Learning) took this approach to a more complex level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can we use this historical understanding?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting current models:</strong>  If a modern NLP model is struggling with a particular linguistic phenomenon, understanding how rule-based systems addressed it can provide insights for feature engineering or model architecture improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the right tool for the job:</strong>  While statistical methods are generally superior, rule-based systems might be more appropriate for highly specific tasks or when data is scarce. For example, parsing a very specific, formal document might benefit from handcrafted grammar rules.</li>
<li><strong>Appreciating the limitations of current technology:</strong> Understanding the historical evolution helps us acknowledge that current NLP systems, even the most advanced ones, are still far from perfect and have limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Informing future research:</strong> By examining the successes and failures of past approaches, we can identify promising directions for future research.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2- Provide an application scenario</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Consider the task of <strong>Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging</strong>, which is the process of assigning grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule-based POS tagging:</strong> A rule-based system might employ a dictionary that lists the possible POS tags for each word. Then, it would apply a series of rules based on the context of the word to disambiguate. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a word is preceded by an article ("a", "an", "the"), and the word is listed as both a noun and a verb, then tag it as a noun.</li>
<li>If a word ends in "-ing" and is preceded by a form of "be", tag it as a verb.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Statistical POS tagging:</strong> A statistical system would be trained on a large corpus of text that has already been POS-tagged (a "gold standard" corpus). The system would learn the probabilities of different POS tags occurring given the word itself and the surrounding words. For example, it might learn that the word "run" is more likely to be a verb if it follows a modal verb (e.g., "can run"). A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) would be a common method here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, statistical tagging is more accurate and robust than rule-based tagging, especially when dealing with complex and ambiguous sentences. Rule-based systems are brittle and require continuous maintenance, while statistical models can adapt to new data.</p>
<p><strong>3- Provide a method to apply in python (if possible)</strong></p>
<p>While implementing a full-fledged rule-based system is complex, and statistical models like HMMs require significant code, we can demonstrate the difference in principle using simpler examples. For statistical NLP, we'll use <code>nltk</code> which provides a pre-trained POS tagger.</p>
<p>python
import nltk</p>
<h1>Example Sentence</h1>
<p>sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."</p>
<h1>Rule-Based (Simplified)</h1>
<p>def rule_based_tagging(sentence):
  """A simplified rule-based POS tagger."""
  words = sentence.split()
  tags = []
  lexicon = {"the": "DET", "quick": "ADJ", "brown": "ADJ", "fox": "NOUN",
             "jumps": "VERB", "over": "PREP", "lazy": "ADJ", "dog": "NOUN"} #Simplified Lexicon</p>
<p>for word in words:
      if word.lower() in lexicon:
          tags.append(lexicon[word.lower()])
      else:
          tags.append("UNKNOWN")  # Handle unknown words
  return list(zip(words, tags))</p>
<h1>Statistical NLP using NLTK</h1>
<p>def statistical_tagging(sentence):
    """Using NLTK's pre-trained POS tagger."""
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)  # Tokenize the sentence
    tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
    return tags</p>
<h1>Apply the rule-based tagger</h1>
<p>rule_based_result = rule_based_tagging(sentence)
print("Rule-Based Tagging:")
print(rule_based_result)</p>
<h1>Apply the statistical tagger</h1>
<p>statistical_result = statistical_tagging(sentence)
print("\nStatistical Tagging (NLTK):")
print(statistical_result)</p>
<h1>Download required resources for NLTK (run this if you haven't used nltk before)</h1>
<h1>nltk.download('punkt') #download sentence tokenizer</h1>
<h1>nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') # download the pretrained tagger</h1>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule-Based:</strong> The <code>rule_based_tagging</code> function uses a simple lexicon (dictionary) to assign tags. Any word not in the lexicon is tagged as "UNKNOWN". This shows the limitations: relies on pre-defined rules, doesn't handle unknown words well, and lacks context sensitivity.</li>
<li><strong>Statistical (NLTK):</strong> The <code>statistical_tagging</code> function uses <code>nltk.pos_tag</code>, a pre-trained POS tagger trained on a large corpus. It can handle many words and leverages statistical patterns.  You will need to download the <code>punkt</code> and <code>averaged_perceptron_tagger</code> resources using <code>nltk.download()</code> if you haven't used them before. The result will give the tagged sentence tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4- Provide a follow up question about that topic</strong></p>
<p>Given the advancements in deep learning, particularly transformers, how has the "rules vs. statistics" dichotomy evolved in modern NLP? Is deep learning simply a more sophisticated form of statistical NLP, or has it introduced fundamentally new capabilities beyond what traditional statistical methods could achieve? Specifically, consider the ability of large language models to perform "few-shot learning" or even "zero-shot learning"—does this blur the lines between rule-based and statistical approaches?</p>
<p><strong>5- Schedule a chatgpt chat to send notification (Simulated)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notification:</strong> Scheduled ChatGPT session for tomorrow, October 27, 2023, at 10:00 AM PST to discuss the follow-up question: "Given the advancements in deep learning, particularly transformers, how has the 'rules vs. statistics' dichotomy evolved in modern NLP?"</p>

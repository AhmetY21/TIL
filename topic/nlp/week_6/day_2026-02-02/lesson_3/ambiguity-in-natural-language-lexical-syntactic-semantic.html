    <h2>Topic: Ambiguity in Natural Language: Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic</h2>
<p><strong>1- Provide formal definition, what is it and how can we use it?</strong></p>
<p>Ambiguity in natural language refers to the possibility of a word, phrase, or sentence having multiple interpretations. This is a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because computers need to understand the intended meaning to process language effectively. There are three main types of ambiguity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lexical Ambiguity:</strong> This occurs when a single word has multiple meanings.  A word's intended meaning can depend on context.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Definition:</em> A word has multiple, distinct senses.</li>
<li><em>Use:</em> Understanding lexical ambiguity is crucial for tasks like word sense disambiguation (WSD), where the goal is to identify the correct sense of a word within a given context.  It also informs semantic analysis and information retrieval to ensure accurate results when handling diverse vocabularies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity:</strong> This arises when a sentence can be parsed (structurally analyzed) in multiple ways, each leading to a different interpretation.  The grouping of words is unclear.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Definition:</em> The structure of a sentence allows for multiple valid parse trees.</li>
<li><em>Use:</em> Resolving syntactic ambiguity is essential for tasks like machine translation, question answering, and text summarization. Incorrect parsing can drastically alter the meaning conveyed to the end user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Ambiguity:</strong>  This occurs when the meaning of a sentence or phrase is unclear even after the lexical and syntactic ambiguities have been resolved. It can arise from vague pronouns, unclear relationships between entities, or logical uncertainties.  It's ambiguity at the level of the overall meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Definition:</em> The meaning derived from a structurally sound sentence is still open to interpretation due to vague references or logical structure.</li>
<li><em>Use:</em> Addressing semantic ambiguity is crucial for understanding the nuances of language and for building systems that can reason about and infer information from text. It's heavily tied to contextual awareness and knowledge representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding and addressing these types of ambiguity, NLP systems can achieve higher accuracy and provide more meaningful results. We use this knowledge to build parsers, disambiguation models, and semantic understanding systems.</p>
<p><strong>2- Provide an application scenario</strong></p>
<p>Consider the sentence: "I saw the man on the hill with a telescope."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lexical Ambiguity:</strong> The word "saw" can refer to either the act of seeing or a tool for cutting.</li>
<li><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity:</strong> Who has the telescope?  Did I see the man <em>while</em> I was on the hill?  Did I see the man <em>who</em> was on the hill?  Was I on the hill or was the man on the hill?  Did the man have the telescope, or was I using the telescope to see him? The sentence can be parsed in multiple ways, leading to different interpretations of who has the telescope and where they are located.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Ambiguity:</strong> Even if we resolve the syntactic ambiguity (e.g., by specifying "I used a telescope to see the man on the hill"), there might still be semantic ambiguity if the hill's significance isn't clear. Is the hill a famous landmark? Does its location have a relevant implication?</li>
</ul>
<p>This example demonstrates how all three types of ambiguity can occur simultaneously in a single sentence and how resolving them is necessary for complete comprehension.  A machine translation system processing this sentence needs to choose the correct parse and word senses to produce an accurate translation. A search engine that indexes the sentence for "men on hills" needs to resolve which character(s) were located on the hill.</p>
<p><strong>3- Provide a method to apply in python (if possible)</strong></p>
<p>While complete disambiguation is a complex task, we can use Python libraries like NLTK and spaCy to address aspects of it. Here's an example using NLTK for lexical ambiguity (Word Sense Disambiguation) using Lesk's Algorithm:</p>
<p>python
import nltk
from nltk.wsd import lesk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize</p>
<p>sentence = "I went to the bank to deposit money."
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)</p>
<h1>Disambiguate the word "bank"</h1>
<p>sense = lesk(tokens, 'bank', context_sentence=tokens)</p>
<p>if sense:
    print(f"The sense of 'bank' in the sentence is: {sense}")
    print(f"Definition: {sense.definition()}")
else:
    print("Could not disambiguate 'bank'.")</p>
<p>sentence2 = "The river bank was overflowing."
tokens2 = word_tokenize(sentence2)</p>
<h1>Disambiguate the word "bank"</h1>
<p>sense2 = lesk(tokens2, 'bank', context_sentence=tokens2)</p>
<p>if sense2:
    print(f"The sense of 'bank' in the sentence is: {sense2}")
    print(f"Definition: {sense2.definition()}")
else:
    print("Could not disambiguate 'bank'.")</p>
<p>This code uses Lesk's algorithm, a simplified approach to WSD. It finds the sense of the word "bank" whose definition has the most overlap with the context of the sentence.  For syntactic parsing, NLTK provides parsers (e.g., <code>nltk.ChartParser</code>), and spaCy offers dependency parsing. For semantic disambiguation, techniques like knowledge representation (using ontologies) and contextual understanding are often applied, which are more complex to implement directly in a short code snippet.  Modern deep learning approaches involving transformer models (like BERT) are also very effective at capturing context and disambiguating word senses, and can be implemented using libraries such as Transformers.</p>
<p><strong>4- Provide a follow up question about that topic</strong></p>
<p>How do modern deep learning models, particularly transformer-based architectures, address the challenges of ambiguity in natural language compared to traditional methods like Lesk's algorithm and rule-based parsers? What are the limitations of deep learning approaches in addressing ambiguity, and what are some emerging techniques for overcoming these limitations?</p>
<p><strong>5- Schedule a chatgpt chat to send notification (Simulated)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: NLP Ambiguity Follow-Up</strong></p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>This is a reminder for our follow-up discussion about ambiguity in Natural Language Processing (lexical, syntactic, semantic). Let's chat tomorrow at 2:00 PM EST to discuss deep learning approaches to ambiguity resolution and their limitations.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>

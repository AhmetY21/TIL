    <h2>Topic: Ambiguity in Natural Language: Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic</h2>
<p><strong>1- Provide formal definition, what is it and how can we use it?</strong></p>
<p>Ambiguity in natural language arises when a sentence or word can have multiple interpretations.  Understanding and resolving ambiguity is crucial for successful natural language processing.  We can use techniques like part-of-speech tagging, parsing, word sense disambiguation, and contextual analysis to identify and resolve these ambiguities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lexical Ambiguity (Word-Level):</strong> This occurs when a single word has multiple meanings. The same word can have different senses depending on the context.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A word can have multiple senses (homonyms, polysemes).</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "Bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.</li>
<li><strong>Use:</strong> Recognizing lexical ambiguity is essential for tasks like machine translation, information retrieval, and question answering.  Without resolving it, the system might choose the wrong meaning and produce incorrect results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity (Structural Ambiguity):</strong> This arises when a sentence has multiple possible parse trees, leading to different interpretations of the relationships between words.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> The grammatical structure of a sentence can be interpreted in more than one way.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "I saw the man with a telescope."  Did I use the telescope to see the man, or did the man have a telescope?</li>
<li><strong>Use:</strong> Resolving syntactic ambiguity is critical for tasks like machine translation, semantic analysis, and information extraction. Incorrect parsing can lead to a misinterpretation of the sentence's meaning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Ambiguity (Meaning-Level):</strong> This occurs when the meaning of the sentence as a whole is unclear or open to interpretation, even when the individual words and their syntactic relationships are understood. This can include scope ambiguity, where quantifiers or operators have multiple possible scopes, or anaphoric ambiguity, where pronouns or other referring expressions can refer to different entities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong>  The sentence has multiple meanings, even with a clear grammatical structure. Often involves unclear relationships or unresolved references.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "The chicken is ready to eat."  Does this mean the chicken is cooked and can be eaten, or is the chicken ready to eat something else? Another example: "Everyone loves someone." Does this mean there is one person everyone loves, or does everyone love a different person? (Scope Ambiguity)</li>
<li><strong>Use:</strong> Resolving semantic ambiguity is crucial for tasks that require deep understanding of language, such as question answering, summarization, and dialogue systems. It allows the system to derive the intended meaning of the sentence within a larger context.
<strong>2- Provide an application scenario</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Consider a search engine trying to answer the query "jaguar".</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lexical Ambiguity:</strong> The word "jaguar" could refer to a car (Jaguar Cars) or an animal (the jaguar cat).</li>
<li><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity:</strong> Imagine a sentence in a news article about the Jaguar car company: "Jaguar released the new model with fanfare." If the search engine incorrectly parses this, it might think a new model of something called "fanfare" was released by Jaguar. While less common in single words, syntactic structure influences the ranking of relevance of the returned articles.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Ambiguity:</strong> Imagine the search engine returns results containing the sentence: "The Jaguar is running fast in the jungle." If the context doesn't specify if it means the car or the animal, the meaning can be unclear without more context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> The search engine needs to disambiguate the user's intent to provide relevant search results. If the user often searches for cars, it should prioritize results related to Jaguar Cars. The search engine can use techniques like query expansion, context analysis, and user profiles to resolve these ambiguities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3- Provide a method to apply in python (if possible)</strong></p>
<p>We can use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy, popular Python libraries for NLP, to demonstrate resolving some aspects of ambiguity. For more complex ambiguity, more sophisticated models (like transformers) are required.</p>
<p>python
import nltk
import spacy</p>
<h1>Download necessary NLTK resources (run once)</h1>
<h1>nltk.download('punkt')</h1>
<h1>nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')</h1>
<h1>nltk.download('wordnet')</h1>
<h1>nltk.download('omw-1.4')</h1>
<h1>Lexical Ambiguity - Word Sense Disambiguation (using WordNet)</h1>
<p>from nltk.corpus import wordnet</p>
<p>def lesk(context_sentence, ambiguous_word):
    """Simple Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation."""
    best_sense = None
    max_overlap = 0
    context = set(context_sentence)
    for synset in wordnet.synsets(ambiguous_word):
        sense = set(synset.definition().split())
        overlap = len(context.intersection(sense))
        if overlap &gt; max_overlap:
            max_overlap = overlap
            best_sense = synset
    return best_sense</p>
<p>sentence = "I went to the bank to deposit money."
word = "bank"
sense = lesk(sentence.split(), word)
print(f"The sense of '{word}' in '{sentence}' is: {sense}")
print(f"Definition: {sense.definition()}")</p>
<h1>Syntactic Ambiguity - using spaCy for part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing</h1>
<p>nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") # Make sure this is installed: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
text = "I saw the man with a telescope."
doc = nlp(text)</p>
<p>print("\nSyntactic Analysis with spaCy:")
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)</p>
<h1>Example to show the ambiguity in the phrase</h1>
<h1>For a real world example, the dependency parser could provide two possible parse trees</h1>
<h1>and those trees will have to be evaluted based on context</h1>
<h1>This is a very simplified example. Real syntactic ambiguity resolution is more complex and often involves probabilistic parsing or statistical models.</h1>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lexical Ambiguity (Word Sense Disambiguation):</strong>  The code uses the simplified Lesk algorithm to determine the most likely sense of the word "bank" in the given sentence based on overlapping words in the context and definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity:</strong> The spaCy code performs part-of-speech tagging (POS) and dependency parsing. While this code <em>doesn't explicitly resolve</em> the syntactic ambiguity, it <em>demonstrates how to obtain the parse tree</em>. A more sophisticated approach would involve comparing different possible parse trees and choosing the most probable one (e.g., using a probabilistic context-free grammar or a neural network-based parser).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are very basic examples. Real-world NLP systems use much more sophisticated techniques, often involving machine learning and deep learning models.</li>
<li>Word sense disambiguation is still a challenging problem in NLP.</li>
<li>Syntactic ambiguity resolution often involves statistical models and probabilities associated with different parse trees.</li>
<li>Semantic ambiguity is the most difficult to resolve and often requires reasoning and world knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4- Provide a follow up question about that topic</strong></p>
<p>How can large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or BERT be used to improve the resolution of semantic ambiguity in complex, real-world scenarios, and what are their limitations in this area?</p>
<p><strong>5- Schedule a chatgpt chat to send notification (Simulated)</strong></p>
<p><em>Simulated Notification: ChatGPT is scheduled to send a reminder to revisit the topic of "Ambiguity in Natural Language: Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic" in 1 week to discuss advancements in LLM-based semantic ambiguity resolution.</em></p>

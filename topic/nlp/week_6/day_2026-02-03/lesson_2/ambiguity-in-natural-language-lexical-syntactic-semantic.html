    <h2>Topic: Ambiguity in Natural Language: Lexical, Syntactic, Semantic</h2>
<p>1- Provide formal definition, what is it and how can we use it?</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ambiguity in natural language arises when a sentence or phrase can be interpreted in more than one way. This uncertainty can stem from different aspects of the language: the words themselves (lexical ambiguity), the structure of the sentence (syntactic ambiguity), or the meaning of the entire sentence in context (semantic ambiguity).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lexical Ambiguity:</strong> Occurs when a single word has multiple meanings.  This is often due to homonyms (words with the same spelling and pronunciation but different meanings, like "bank" - river bank or financial institution) or polysemes (words with related meanings, like "bright" - shining or intelligent).</li>
<li><strong>Syntactic Ambiguity (Structural Ambiguity):</strong> Arises when the grammatical structure of a sentence allows for multiple interpretations.  This often involves prepositional phrase attachment ("I saw the man on the hill with a telescope"), phrase boundaries, or modifier placement.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Ambiguity:</strong> Occurs even when the lexical and syntactic structure are clear, but the overall meaning of the sentence is still open to different interpretations. This can be due to vague pronoun references, quantifier scope ambiguities ("Every man loves a woman" - does each man love a specific woman, or is there a woman that all men love?), or the use of figurative language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can we use it?</strong>  Understanding and addressing ambiguity is crucial for a variety of NLP tasks. It's essential for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Translation:</strong> Accurately translating sentences requires disambiguating the source language to avoid propagating incorrect interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Information Retrieval:</strong>  Search engines need to understand the intended meaning of a query to provide relevant results.</li>
<li><strong>Text Summarization:</strong>  Generating concise summaries relies on correctly interpreting the main points of the text, which may be obscured by ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Question Answering:</strong>  Answering questions accurately demands understanding the question's intent, which can be affected by ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Correctly identifying the sentiment in a sentence requires correctly understanding the meaning of the words and structure. For example, sarcasm relies on meaning something opposite to what is said.</li>
<li><strong>Chatbots and Conversational AI:</strong>  To engage in meaningful conversations, chatbots must be able to resolve ambiguities in user input and respond appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p>2- Provide an application scenario</p>
<p><strong>Application Scenario: Medical Diagnosis Support System</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a medical diagnosis support system that helps doctors analyze patient reports. A sentence like "Patient reports severe pain in the arm after falling from a tree" can be syntactically ambiguous.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation 1:</strong> The patient fell from a tree and subsequently reported pain in the arm. (The fall <em>caused</em> the pain)</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation 2:</strong> The patient was in the arm, falling from a tree. (The arm was falling from the tree)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the system interprets the sentence as meaning the patient was <em>in</em> the arm whilst falling, it will potentially misdiagnose or overlook the actual injury. Furthermore, consider "The doctor examined the child's broken arm." This is lexically unambiguous, but <em>semantic</em> ambiguity could arise if "the child" has already been mentioned with multiple different possibilities, such as "The girl and her mother arrived at the clinic. The doctor examined the child's broken arm." Resolving <em>coreference</em> is needed to understand whose arm. The system needs to be able to disambiguate the sentence structure and pronoun referents to extract accurate information about the patient's condition and injury.</p>
<p>3- Provide a method to apply in python (if possible)</p>
<p><strong>Python Implementation using NLTK and spaCy (Illustrative)</strong></p>
<p>This example focuses on demonstrating how to detect and (partially) resolve some forms of ambiguity using basic NLP techniques in Python. It is important to note that fully resolving ambiguity is a very complex task that often requires advanced techniques such as machine learning and contextual knowledge.</p>

  synsets = wordnet.synsets(word)
  if synsets:
    print(f"Word: {word}")
    for synset in synsets:
      print(f"- Definition: {synset.definition()}")
      print(f"  Examples: {synset.examples()}")
  else:
    print(f"Word: {word} - No senses found in WordNet.")</p>
<p>def syntactic_ambiguity(sentence):
  """Demonstrates syntactic ambiguity using constituency parsing (very basic)."""
  tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
  tagged = pos_tag(tokens) # Part of speech tagging</p>
<p>print(f"Sentence: {sentence}")
  print(f"POS Tags: {tagged}") # Helps understand potential structure</p>
<p>#A full constituency parse is needed for robust detection, which this is not.
  #However, POS tagging can reveal potential ambiguities.</p>
<p>def coreference_resolution(text):
    """
    Demonstrates basic coreference resolution using spaCy.  This is a VERY
    simplified example and real coreference resolution is much more complex.
    """
    doc = nlp(text)
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    for token in doc:
        print(f"{token.text}: {token.dep_}")  # Show dependency parsing</p>
<h1>Example usage</h1>
<p>lexical_ambiguity("bank")
print("-" * 20)</p>
<p>sentence = "I saw the man on the hill with a telescope"
syntactic_ambiguity(sentence)
print("-" * 20)</p>
<p>text = "The girl and her mother arrived at the clinic. The doctor examined the child's broken arm."
coreference_resolution(text)
print("-" * 20)</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>lexical_ambiguity(word)</code>:</strong>  Uses NLTK's WordNet to find different senses (meanings) of a word.  It prints the definitions and examples for each sense.</li>
<li><strong><code>syntactic_ambiguity(sentence)</code>:</strong>  Performs Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using NLTK.  While this doesn't fully resolve syntactic ambiguity, it provides information about the potential grammatical roles of words, which can highlight structural ambiguities.  A full parse would be needed to really demonstrate.</li>
<li><strong><code>coreference_resolution(text)</code>:</strong> This uses spaCy to perform dependency parsing. The dependency parsing output provides information about how words are related to each other in the sentence, which can be helpful for understanding the context and resolving coreference (identifying which entities are being referred to by pronouns and other referring expressions).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a simplified illustration. Real-world ambiguity resolution requires much more sophisticated techniques, including:<ul>
<li>Probabilistic parsing</li>
<li>Semantic role labeling</li>
<li>Machine learning models trained on large corpora</li>
<li>Contextual knowledge bases</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4- Provide a follow up question about that topic</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up Question:</strong> How can deep learning models, specifically Transformers, be used to effectively address both syntactic and semantic ambiguity in natural language, and what are the current limitations of these models in handling complex forms of ambiguity like those involving sarcasm or idiomatic expressions?</p>

<h2 id="1-formal-definition-what-is-it-and-how-can-we-use-it">1) Formal definition (what is it, and how can we use it?)</h2>
<p>The history of NLP: From Rules to Statistics describes the evolution of approaches used to process and understand human language by computers. It charts a course from early, symbolic rule-based systems to modern, data-driven statistical and machine learning models.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule-Based NLP:</strong> This early phase relied on manually crafted rules (often using regular expressions and context-free grammars) to analyze and generate text.  These rules encoded linguistic knowledge (morphology, syntax, semantics) and explicitly specified how to parse sentences, extract meaning, and generate responses. These systems were often brittle and struggled to handle the inherent ambiguity and variability of natural language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Statistical NLP:</strong> The statistical approach emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s as computational power and the availability of text data (corpora) increased. This paradigm shift involved treating language as a stochastic process, where probabilities are assigned to different linguistic units and structures.  Algorithms like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Naive Bayes were used for tasks like part-of-speech tagging and text classification. This approach automatically learned patterns from data, making it more robust to noisy and unseen data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Learning NLP:</strong> Building upon statistical methods, the Machine Learning era involved using algorithms capable of learning complex patterns from large datasets without explicit programming.  This includes approaches like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and, more recently, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are trained on massive datasets and can perform a wide range of NLP tasks with high accuracy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we use this history? Understanding this historical progression provides context for current NLP techniques. It helps us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appreciate the limitations of rule-based systems:</strong>  Recognizing why rule-based approaches failed allows us to better understand the advantages of data-driven models.</li>
<li><strong>Choose appropriate methods:</strong> Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of statistical and machine learning models enables us to select the best approach for a specific NLP task.</li>
<li><strong>Understand current research directions:</strong>  The evolution of NLP reveals ongoing trends and areas of active research, such as improving model explainability, handling low-resource languages, and addressing biases in NLP systems.</li>
<li><strong>Debug and improve existing models:</strong> An understanding of the historical constraints allows developers to avoid repeating past mistakes and focus on improvements that meaningfully advance the field.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-application-scenario">2) Application scenario</h2>
<p>Consider the task of <strong>spam detection</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule-Based Approach:</strong> A rule-based system might identify spam based on keywords (e.g., "Viagra," "free money," "urgent"), excessive use of exclamation marks, or suspicious sender addresses.  While easy to implement initially, spammers quickly learn to circumvent these rules (e.g., using misspellings, images instead of text). Maintaining the rules becomes a constant cat-and-mouse game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Statistical Approach (Naive Bayes):</strong> A Naive Bayes classifier learns the probability of specific words appearing in spam versus non-spam (ham) emails.  It calculates the probability that a given email is spam based on the words it contains.  This is more robust than a rule-based system because it learns patterns automatically from a training dataset.  For example, even if the word "Viagra" is misspelled as "Viagraa," the classifier might still flag it as spam if "Viagraa" frequently appears in spam emails in the training data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Approach (Deep Learning/Transformers):</strong> A deep learning model, such as a Transformer, can learn even more complex patterns and contextual relationships in emails. It can understand the subtle nuances of language that might indicate spam, such as phishing attempts or sophisticated scams. It might recognize that an email with unusually formal language, a sense of urgency, and a request for personal information is likely spam, even if it doesn't contain explicit spam keywords.  Furthermore, it can learn representations of emails (embeddings) that capture semantic similarity, allowing it to generalize to new spam techniques effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-python-method-if-possible">3) Python method (if possible)</h2>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample data (replace with a real dataset)
emails = [
    &quot;Free money! Claim your prize now!&quot;,
    &quot;Important meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.&quot;,
    &quot;Get 50% off on Viagra today!&quot;,
    &quot;Meeting postponed. Will update schedule soon.&quot;,
    &quot;You have won a free trip to Bahamas!&quot;
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  # 1 = spam, 0 = ham

# Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(emails)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f&quot;Accuracy: {accuracy}&quot;)

# Example of prediction on a new email
new_email = [&quot;Urgent: Need your bank details ASAP!&quot;]
new_email_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(new_email)
prediction = classifier.predict(new_email_vectorized)[0]
print(f&quot;Prediction for '{new_email[0]}': {'Spam' if prediction == 1 else 'Ham'}&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>This example shows how to use a simple statistical method (Naive Bayes) for spam detection in Python. It uses TF-IDF to vectorize the text data.  Deep learning solutions would require much larger datasets and more complex model architectures.</p>
<h2 id="4-follow-up-question">4) Follow-up question</h2>
<p>Given the current dominance of deep learning models in NLP, are rule-based or statistical methods still relevant today, and in what scenarios might they be preferred?</p>
